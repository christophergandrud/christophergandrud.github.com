<p>I just noticed that <a href='http://lamages.blogspot.com/2012/05/interactive-html-presentation-with-r.html'>Markus Gesmann</a> has a nice post on using <strong>RStudio</strong>, <code>knitr</code>, <strong>Pandoc</strong>, and <strong>Slidy</strong> to create slideshows. After my <a href='http://christophergandrud.blogspot.com/2012/05/aspirational-useful-deckrb-with.html'>recent attempt</a> to use <code>deck.rb</code> to turn a <strong>Markdown</strong>/<code>knitr</code> file into a deck.js presentation I caved in and also decided to go with <a href='http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html'>Pandoc</a> and <a href='http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy2/'>Slidy</a>.</p>

<p>For me, Slidy produced the cleanest slides of the three formats that Pandoc supports. The presentation is <a href='http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12581470/Presentations/LegViolence/leg_violence_present1.html'>here</a> and the source is <a href='http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12581470/Presentations/LegViolence/leg_violence_present1.Rmd'>here</a>.</p>

<p>The only thing I really disliked was having to use <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> or something similar to keep the text from bunching up at the top of the slides, which looked strange when projected onto a screen. You can customise Slidy CSS files, but I haven&#8217;t got around to that yet.</p>

<p>In this post I don&#8217;t want to duplicate what Markus Gesmann has already done. Instead, I wanted to mention two things that I noticed/thought about while making my presentation:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The new <strong>MathJax</strong> syntax <a href='http://blog.rstudio.org/2012/05/25/mathjax-syntax-change/'>implemented in RStudio 0.96.227</a> doesn&#8217;t seem to work with Pandoc. It just renders <em>latex</em> as if it was part of the equation rather than the qualifier to the equation begin delimiter. To get around this I just used the regular old <code>$ $</code> and <code>$$ $$</code> syntax.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty easy to host presentations with <strong>Dropbox</strong>. Just make sure all of your files are in the same folder in your <code>Public</code> folder. If you want output from <code>knitr</code> to go into and be retrieved from someplace else, you can use the desired base URL for these files by adding this code <em>after</em> the Pandoc title information:</p>

<pre><code>  ```{r setup, echo=FALSE}

  # Set up R so that figures save and load properly.    
  opts_knit$set(base.url = &quot;&quot;)

  ```</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Where <code>base.url = &quot;&quot;</code> includes the URL of the folder you want the output stored in.</p>

<ul>
<li>All items in a folder in Dropbox&#8217;s <code>Public</code> folder have the same base URL.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>I learned about <code>base.url</code> from <a href='http://yihui.name/'>Yihui Xie&#8217;s</a> source code for his <code>knitr</code>/Markdown <a href='https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/inst/examples/knitr-minimal.md'>example on github</a>. He uses it to save and retrieve figures from other folders on github.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='extra_pandoc_code'>Extra: Pandoc Code</h3>

<p>I used the following Pandoc code in the Terminal to convert the <code>.md</code> file to Slidy:</p>

<pre><code>pandoc -t slidy leg_violence_present1.md -o leg_violence_present1.html -s -i -S --mathjax</code></pre>
