<p>Tools for using <strong>R</strong>/<strong>RStudio</strong> as a one-stop shop for research and presentation have been coming out quickly. I think this one has a good shot of being included in future releases of <strong>RStudio</strong>:</p>

<p>The other day I ran across a new <strong>R</strong> package called <a href='http://ramnathv.github.com/slidify/'>slidify</a> by <a href='http://rstats.posterous.com/'>Ramnath Vaidyanathan</a>. In <a href='http://christophergandrud.blogspot.kr/2012/05/knitr-slideshows-and-dropbox.html'>previous</a> <a href='http://christophergandrud.blogspot.kr/2012/05/aspirational-useful-deckrb-with.html'>posts</a> I had been messing around with <strong>Pandoc</strong> and <strong>deck.rb</strong> to turn <code>knitr</code> Markdown files into HTML presentations.</p>

<p>Slidify has two key advantages over these approaches:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>it can directly convert <code>.Rnw</code> files in <strong>R</strong> into slideshows, i.e. no toggling between <strong>R</strong> and the Terminal,</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>there are lots of slideshow options (<a href='http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/'>deck.js</a>, <a href='http://paulrouget.com/dzslides/'>dzslides</a>, <a href='https://code.google.com/p/html5slides/'>html5slides</a>, <a href=''>shower</a>, and <a href='http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy2/'>slidy</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#8217;s not on CRAN yet, but it worked pretty well for me.</p>

<p>The syntax is simple.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In the Markdown document demarcate new slides with <code>---</code> (it has to be three dashes and there can&#8217;t be spaces after the dashes).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When you want to convert your <code>.Rnw</code> into a presentation just type:</p>

<pre><code>  library(slidify)
  slidify(&quot;presentation.Rnw&quot;)</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The default style is <strong>html5slides</strong>. The package isn&#8217;t that well documented right now, but to change to a different style just use <code>framework</code>. For example:</p>

<pre><code>    slidify(&quot;presentation.Rnw&quot;, framework = &quot;deck.js&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>I used slidify to put together a slideshow that advertises an intro applied stats course I&#8217;m teaching next semester. The slideshow is <a href='https://dl.dropbox.com/u/12581470/Presentations/ad_DataAnalysis_2012/ad_data.html'>here</a>. (You can see that I&#8217;m trying to attract social science students who are reluctant to take a stats class).</p>

<p>I sloppily removed the default Slidify logo by deleting the <code>images</code> folder in the <code>html5slides</code> folder slidify creates.</p>

<h3 id='ps'>PS</h3>

<p>Oh, also you might notice that I&#8217;m using <a href='https://github.com/'>github</a> to host the course. I hope to blog about this in the near future.</p>
