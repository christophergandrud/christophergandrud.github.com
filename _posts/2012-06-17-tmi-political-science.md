I just finished reading [Lisa Anderson](http://www.aucegypt.edu/about/president/Pages/default.aspx)'s somewhat didactic article in the most recent issue of [Perspectives on Politics](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayJournal?jid=PPS). It's called: [Too Much Information? Political Science, the University, and the Public Sphere](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8593753).

In the article she is concerned about the role of academic political scientists in a world where students and policymakers have free access to large amounts of information. To a certain extent I think her description of the present's distinctiveness from the past is a bit overblown. Much like how communication today is not drastically faster than in the past (at least since the laying of [transoceanic telegraph cables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transatlantic_telegraph_cable) ), she probably overstates the primacy of political scientists as ''central to the development, collection, and dissemination of knowledge''. For example, think tanks--which she and [Stephen Walt identify](http://publicsphere.ssrc.org/walt-international-affairs-and-the-public-sphere/) as challengers to academic political science primacy as sources of information--are certainly not new. 

At the same time, I think she overly downplays the contemporary importance of academic political scientists as gatherers of new information, i.e. as researchers. Much of the best political science research today uses new technologies--like web scraping and analysing Twitter feeds--to gather new information. Technological advancements that are driving the free access of greater information, similarly make it easier for these researchers to disseminate what they have found. Political science is already part of these new processes.  

However, I really enjoyed her overall insights about how political scientists could reorient ourselves to a world of 'too much information'. She argues that we 

> need to revitalize the spirit of playful inventive, open excitement that is, or should be, the hallmark of genuine education--and to do that \[we\] will need to remember that, unlike the think tanks and policy shops of the world, \[our\] principle line of work is, well, *education*.

Initially, it was unclear to me why this is any more necessary for contemporary political scientists than those in the past. On second thought there is a new pressure created by technological change. Given the quickly improving quality of distance education courses offered by [prestigious universities](http://www.harvard.edu/faqs/distance-learning) and by people who do bring a 'playful inventiveness' to their teaching it is unclear why people would accept anything less. 

Somewhat more directly tied to recent technological advances, she argues that:

> Presenting the finished, polished, completed findings from research conducted in a political science department to policymakers . . . is neither what today's policymakers need--it takes to long to produce, it is not interactive or mobile, it precludes questions: in short , it does not reflect the requirements of the audience, any audience today--nor is it what a true political scientist is, or should be, really good at.

The conclusions she draws here are perhaps too strong. There is certainly a role for information developed to the quality required for scholarly publication. Nonetheless, this point particularly resonated with me, given my own recent blogging on [preliminary](http://christophergandrud.blogspot.kr/2012/02/update-to-partisan-bias-in-fed.html)  [research findings](http://christophergandrud.blogspot.kr/2012/04/graphing-predicting-legislative.html) and work [making data more accessible](http://christophergandrud.blogspot.kr/2012/06/data-on-github-easy-way-to-make-your.html).  

One of the central challenges for academics of my generation, will likely be finding a balance where our research is timely, directly benefits our students and policymakers and itself benefits from a wider community's input while also achieving a high academic quality. 

Finally, I used to be somewhat skeptical of the sort of buzzwords in the next quote. However, the more I have become engaged with new technologies and ways of conducting research and teaching, the more I recognise their importance for the ways higher education and high level research is changing, I think for the better:

> . . . what we do in our professional lives should be about learning . . . ''life-long learning'' \[is\] erasing the categorical distinctions between student and teacher. The hierarchical relationship of deference once accorded those with privileged access to information is fast disappearing, replaced by collaborative learning, crowd-sourcing, social networks, and webs of reciprocity.
